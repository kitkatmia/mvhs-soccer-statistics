# MVHS Soccer Statistics

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze soccer game data to provide insights into the MVHS team's performance, with a specific focus on possession statistics. The goal is to identify areas where the team can improve and provide valuable information to the coaches for strategic decision-making.

## File Structure

The project is organized as follows:

MVHS_Soccer_Statistics/
├── data/
│ └── \*.csv (game data files, e.g., possession_data.csv, goal_scorers.csv)
├── snapshot_1/
│ └── analysis_1.py (data analysis for first 4 games)
└── snapshot_2/
└── analysis_2.py (data analysis for next 4 games)

## Data Analysis Approach

1. Data Collection:

Game data is collected into CSV files in the data folder.
Key metrics include possession percentage, goal scorers, and other relevant statistics. 2. Snapshot Analysis:

Data is analyzed in chunks of 4 games within Python files in the snapshot_1 and snapshot_2 folders.
Each snapshot focuses on identifying patterns and trends in possession and other key metrics. 3. Python Libraries:

pandas is used for data manipulation and cleaning.
matplotlib is used for creating visualizations to aid in interpretation.

## Future Work

Expand the analysis to include a wider range of metrics and performance indicators.
Automate data collection and analysis for ongoing tracking and reporting.
Explore interactive visualizations to enhance data exploration and communication.
Collaborate with coaches to integrate insights into training strategies and game plans.
